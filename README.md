In this assignment, the goal was to analyze the weather patterns and preciptation in Hawaii.  The dataset included data from 2010 to 2017. There were a few days out of the month where "I" chose to go on vacation, and historical weather patterns were gathered from those dates. 

The precipitation values were gathered for the last 12 months and plotted on ![Precipitation](/Saved_images/precipitation.png) .
